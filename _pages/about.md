I am an oceanographer who studies the physics of the ocean. To this day, I have done research on topics such as internal waves, small-scale turbulence, and interactions of waves and currents with topography. Iâ€™m broadly in making measurements of processes that regulate how the ocean moves and using models to unravel how these processes work.

I am currently a PhD candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California San Diego (SIO/UCSD) and I work in the Multiscale Ocean Dynamics group (MOD). In my thesis research, I have been using in-situ observations from Tasmania to understand the energy pathways of a remote internal tide impinging on the continental slope of Tasmania (check out the T-TIDE).
