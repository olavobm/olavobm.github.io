I am an oceanographer who studies the physics of the ocean. To this day, I have done research on topics such as internal waves, small-scale turbulence, and interactions of waves and currents with topography. Iâ€™m broadly in making measurements of processes that regulate how the ocean moves and using models to unravel how these processes work.

I am currently a PhD candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California San Diego (SIO/UCSD) and I work in the [Multiscale Ocean Dynamics group (MOD)](http://www.mod.ucsd.edu/). In my thesis research, I have been using in-situ observations to understand the energy pathways of a remote internal tide impinging on the continental slope of Tasmania (check out the [T-TIDE webpage](https://sioweb.ucsd.edu/projects/ttide/)).

In my free time, I have been:
* reading: [Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Rider:_Travels_on_the_Healing_Road), by Neil Peart (2002)
* listening: [Whoosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoosh!), by Deep Purple (2020).
